## Question 5: Practicing More Linux Commands

This script demonstrates a variety of Linux commands covered in the JavaTpoint Linux Tutorial. All operations are performed without root privileges and simulate realistic system usage.

### Commands Practiced:

- `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`: Creating directories and files
- `ls`, `pwd`: Listing and printing current directory
- `date`, `whoami`, `uname -a`: Viewing system and user info
- `mv`, `cp`: Renaming and copying files
- `find`, `grep`: Searching for files and patterns
- `wc`: Counting lines, words, characters
- `tar`: Creating a compressed archive
- `rm -rf`: Clean up after practice

These commands are foundational for daily Linux usage and prepare students for more advanced scripting and administration.
