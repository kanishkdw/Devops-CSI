# Notes â€“ Branch Security and Locking in Azure DevOps

- Branch security helps define granular access control to branches.
- Locking a branch prevents users from pushing changes directly.
- This improves CI/CD hygiene and enforces code quality.
- Admins retain full control while developers are pushed to use PRs.
- Branch policies like required reviewers and build validation can be layered on top.
