# Notes on Branch Policies and Security

## 🔐 Branch Policy
Branch policies enforce quality control on the code before it’s merged.

### Common Policies:
- **Minimum reviewers**: Ensures peer review before merging.
- **Build validation**: Verifies that PRs don’t break the build.
- **Work item linking**: Ensures traceability of changes.
- **Comment resolution**: Ensures all PR feedback is addressed.

## 🔐 Branch Security
Controls who can read/write/manage branches.

### Examples:
- **Admins** can push, delete, and manage permissions.
- **Contributors** may have read or limited push access only.

## 📌 Importance:
- Enforces collaboration and code quality.
- Prevents unauthorized or accidental changes.
- Adds governance and traceability in enterprise DevOps pipelines.
