In the same YAML pipeline, add a scheduled trigger block:

schedules:
- cron: "0 3 * * *"
  displayName: Daily 3AM build
  branches:
    include:
      - main
  always: true


This schedules the pipeline to run daily at 3:00 AM UTC.

Click the lightning bolt âš¡ on the artifact.

Enable Continuous Deployment Trigger.
