# Pull Request Overview

A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows the team to review the changes before merging them into the main branch.

- **Advantages of Pull Requests:**
  - Enables code review before merging into the main branch.
  - Facilitates collaboration and communication among team members.
  - Helps maintain code quality by ensuring changes are reviewed.

- **How PRs Work:**
  1. A developer creates a new branch and makes changes.
  2. They push the branch to GitHub and create a PR.
  3. The PR is reviewed by others and merged if it is approved.

- **GitHub Workflow:**
  - Use GitHub's interface to create, review, and merge PRs.
  - PRs can be merged via the UI or by using the `git merge` command.
