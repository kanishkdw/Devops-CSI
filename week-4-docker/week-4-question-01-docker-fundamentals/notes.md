# Notes - Docker Basics

- Docker is a platform to build, run, and manage containers.
- Containers are lightweight, fast, and consistent across environments.
- `hello-world` image is the simplest Docker container to verify installation.
- `docker ps` shows running containers; `docker ps -a` includes stopped ones.
- Removing unused images and containers helps clean the Docker environment.
