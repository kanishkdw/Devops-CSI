## Notes - DockerHub & Multi-Stage Build

- Multi-stage builds help reduce image size by separating build and runtime stages.
- DockerHub is a cloud-based registry for storing and sharing container images.
- Use `docker login` once per session to authenticate to DockerHub.
- You can check pushed images at: https://hub.docker.com/repositories
