## Question 3: Navigating and Moving Files Using the Terminal

This script demonstrates how to:

- Navigate directories using `cd`
- List contents with `ls` and `ls -l`
- Display current location using `pwd`
- Create directories using `mkdir -p`
- Create files using `touch`
- Move files using `mv`

### Key Examples:
- `cd ~/terminal_practice/people/marketing` navigates to a nested directory
- `ls --classify` distinguishes files from directories
- `mv file destination/` moves files between directories
- `cd ..` is used to go up one directory
- `pwd` confirms current working directory

By practicing these operations, you gain hands-on familiarity with directory structure, movement, and file manipulation in a Linux shell.
