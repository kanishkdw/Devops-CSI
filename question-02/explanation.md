## Question 2: Executing Basic Linux Commands

This script demonstrates essential Linux file and directory commands with a focus on practical usage and output understanding.

### Commands used:

- `pwd`: Prints the current directory.
- `mkdir`: Creates directories. Used with `-p` to create nested directories.
- `file`: Identifies the type of a file or directory.
- `ls -l`: Lists directory contents with details.
- `ls -R`: Recursively lists contents of nested directories.
- `touch`: Creates empty files.
- `rm`: Removes files.
- `rm -r`: Recursively removes directories and their contents.
- `rmdir`: Deletes an empty directory.
- `cd`: Navigates between directories.

This workflow demonstrates how to safely create and remove files and folders while observing results using commands like `ls`, `file`, and `pwd`.
